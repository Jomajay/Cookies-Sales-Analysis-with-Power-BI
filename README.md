### **Dashboard Analysis**

1. **Total Revenue and Customer Overview:**  
   At a glance, the dashboard reveals a **total revenue of $4.69 million** generated by **5 unique customers**. This section gives a quick snapshot of the overall sales scale, highlighting that even with a limited customer base, significant revenue can be achieved. This perspective is valuable for understanding the financial impact of each customer relationship.

2. **Revenue by Customer:**  
   The “Revenue by Customer” chart emphasizes customer contributions. **ACME Bites** leads with **$1.43 million**, followed by **Wholesome Foods** with **$1.08 million**. This insight points to our key clients, showing where our strongest partnerships lie. The smaller contributions from **Park & Shop Convenience Stores** and **Tres Delicious** indicate areas with growth potential, suggesting the need for targeted campaigns or enhanced service offerings to boost their engagement.

3. **Revenue Gauge:**  
   The revenue gauge shows how close we are to reaching our **$5 million** target, with **$4.69 million** (about **94%** of the goal) already achieved. This gauge acts as a performance checkpoint, visually reminding the team of their progress toward the target, which can help drive efforts to push the remaining percentage.

4. **Trend of Revenue Over Time:**  
   By visualizing revenue over time, this line chart reveals periods of high and low sales. Notable peaks in **September 2020** and **November 2020**, each around **$0.4 million**, suggest that specific times of the year are particularly profitable. Understanding these trends aids in preparing for future demand, ensuring that resources and marketing efforts are aligned with peak seasons.

5. **Revenue by Product:**  
   **Chocolate Chip** cookies dominate the product lineup, generating **$1.7 million** in revenue, followed by **White Chocolate** and **Oatmeal Raisin** with **$1 million** and **$0.8 million**, respectively. Lower performers, like **Fortune Cookie** with **$0.2 million**, point to products that may need additional marketing support or re-evaluation. This view of product performance is crucial for making data-backed decisions on product positioning and promotions.

6. **Orders by Customer and Product:**  
   The clustered bar chart breaks down orders by customer and product, illustrating buying behaviors and preferences. **ACME Bites** has high order volumes for **Chocolate Chip**, whereas **ABC Groceries** shows a more diversified interest. This information is useful for creating personalized recommendations and promotions tailored to each customer’s buying patterns, helping to build stronger relationships.

7. **Interactive Filters:**  
   With filters for **Customer Name** and **City**, users can easily refine the data to focus on specific segments, such as analyzing trends for a particular city like **Green Bay** or viewing performance for an individual customer. These interactive elements make it easy for users to gain insights at a granular level, facilitating targeted strategy development.
